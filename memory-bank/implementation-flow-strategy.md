# Implementation Flow Strategy

## Strategic Approach: Backend-First with Early Wins

### Core Philosophy
**"Working RAG System in 3 Weeks"** - Build a minimal but functional RAG system that can process documents and answer questions, then iterate and enhance.

### Why Backend-First?
1. **Core Value Delivery**: RAG functionality is the core business value
2. **Technical Validation**: Validate AI/ML integration early
3. **API-First Design**: Frontend can be built against stable APIs
4. **Parallel Development**: Once APIs exist, frontend and backend can develop in parallel
5. **Early Testing**: Backend functionality can be tested via API calls/Postman

## Risk Mitigation Strategies

### Technical Risks
```python
# Risk: AI API Integration Issues
# Mitigation: Start with simple API calls, build complexity gradually
# Fallback: Use OpenAI APIs if Gemini has issues

# Risk: Vector Database Performance
# Mitigation: Start with small datasets, optimize later
# Fallback: Use Pinecone if Qdrant has issues

# Risk: Complex Microservices
# Mitigation: Start with monolithic structure, extract services later
# Fallback: Keep everything in one service initially
```

### Timeline Risks
```python
# Risk: Feature Creep
# Mitigation: Strict MVP scope, defer advanced features
# Strategy: "Working system first, perfect system later"

# Risk: Integration Complexity
# Mitigation: Test integrations early and often
# Strategy: Build integration tests from day 1

# Risk: Performance Issues
# Mitigation: Focus on functionality first, optimize later
# Strategy: Measure performance, don't guess
```

### Retrieval Configuration Management

#### Dynamic Strategy Selection
```python
# Configurable Retrieval Strategies:
RETRIEVAL_STRATEGIES = {
    "fast": {
        "vector_top_k": 10,
        "reranking": False,
        "mmr": False,
        "use_case": "Quick responses, high volume"
    },
    "balanced": {
        "vector_top_k": 20,
        "bm25_boost": True,
        "reranking": True,
        "rerank_top_k": 10,
        "mmr": True,
        "final_k": 5,
        "use_case": "Standard RAG queries"
    },
    "comprehensive": {
        "vector_top_k": 50,
        "bm25_boost": True,
        "reranking": True,
        "rerank_top_k": 20,
        "mmr": True,
        "final_k": 8,
        "use_case": "Complex research queries"
    }
}
```

#### Performance Optimization
```python
# Caching and Performance:
PERFORMANCE_CONFIG = {
    "embedding_cache": {
        "enabled": True,
        "ttl": 3600,  # 1 hour
        "max_size": 10000
    },
    "retrieval_cache": {
        "enabled": True,
        "ttl": 300,   # 5 minutes
        "max_size": 1000
    },
    "async_processing": {
        "enabled": True,
        "max_concurrent": 10,
        "timeout": 30
    }
}
```
